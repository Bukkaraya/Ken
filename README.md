# Ken
A processor that is based on a 16 bit MIPS like architecture
Only a subset of the MIPS instructions have been implemented

The instructions that have been implemented are

- R Type Addition
- Immediate Addition
- Jump
- Branch Equal To (beq)
- Load Word
- Store Word

The instruction memory has an implementation of a program that
computes the nth Fibbonacci number.
